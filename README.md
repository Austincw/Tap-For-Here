# Tap For Here: NFC Attendance Taking
Tap for Hereâ€™s mission is to create a simple to use smartphone application for students to count themselves as attended for their classes while at the same time giving professors convenience and access to creating and viewing updated attendance records.

# Dependencies
**Currently the only devices we are supporting are iPhones 7 and newer, Android is planned to come later**<br>
`Firebase` <br>
`Composer` <br>
`XAMPP` is what we used but you are free to use whatever server you want <br>
`XCode`<br>

# Installation
In order to use both the iOS application and the website portal you will need to install the dependencies above first.  Once you have them installed you should be able to clone this repo onto your computer with <br>
`git clone https://github.com/Austincw/Tap-For-Here`
<br>
<br>
Now that you have the project on your computer you should be able to open the xcode workspace file in XCode just fine to then install to your iOS device(Make sure it is an iPhone 7 or newer)
<br>
<br>
For installing the webportal, first you will want to get the contents that are within the webportal folder.  This is where you want to have `composer` downloaded and installed on your computer in order to run the files within this folder.  The directory should be as follows: `webportal/SeniorProjWeb_Final/firebase`.  It is recommended to open the `SeniorProjWeb_Final/` directory in your IDE/Editor of choice to begin editing the html, php, and JS files.  **Everything inside of the `SeniorProjWeb_Final/firebase/` folder is needed in order to be firebase capable in php.**  Please make sure not to edit any files inside the vendor, secret, and .idea folders.
